# Learn SpongePowered API

SpongePowered is a community-driven open source plugin development framework for Minecraft. It is mostly used for multiplayer servers as an alternative to Bukkit/Spigot API and can be integrated nicely with client-side Forge mods.
There are two implementations - SpongeForge and SpongeVanilla.
